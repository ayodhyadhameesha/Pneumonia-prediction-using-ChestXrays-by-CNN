# Pneumonia-prediction-using-ChestXrays-by-CNN
In this repository a Convolution Neural Network is implemented to examine the patient Xrays and predict whether its a normal XRay or Pneumonia XRay.Neural networks are used in this process.
But we cannot guarantee that this 100% accurate there can be several circumstances which affect pneumonia. 
But this can be used as help to examines and anybody can try this and see whether the results are good. 
Hope you will create a good discussion from this.
